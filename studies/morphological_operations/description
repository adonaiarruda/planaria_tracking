The morphological operations covered:

- Erosion
- Dilation
- Opening
- Closing
- Morphological gradient
- Black hat
- Top hat (also called “White hat”)


And sometimes a clever use of morphological operations can allow you to avoid more complicated (and computationally expensive) machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
